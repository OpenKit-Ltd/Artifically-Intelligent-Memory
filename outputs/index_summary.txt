1. Imports:
- `serve` from `http/server.ts`
- `createClient` from `supabase`
- `corsHeaders` from `../cors.ts`
- `handleSensoryInput` from `./database.ts`

2. The code starts a server using `serve` and listens for incoming requests. If the request method is `OPTIONS`, it returns a response with CORS headers. Otherwise, it sets up a Supabase client using `createClient` and gets the user object using `getUser`. It then parses the request body for `input` and `source` and passes them to `handleSensoryInput`. The response is returned with CORS headers and a JSON content type.

3. Function calls:
- `serve`: takes a callback function as its argument.
- `createClient`: takes three arguments in the following order: Supabase URL, Supabase anonymous key, and an object with global headers.
- `getUser`: takes no arguments.
- `req.json()`: takes no arguments.
- `handleSensoryInput`: takes three arguments in the following order: Supabase client, input, and source.

4. Function definitions:
- `handleSensoryInput`: takes three arguments in the following order: Supabase client, input, and source. Returns a Promise that resolves to an object with `success` and `message` properties. This function inserts the `input` and `source` into a Supabase table and returns a success message.

5. Variables:
- `supabaseClient`: a Supabase client object.
- `user`: an object containing user information.
- `input`: a string containing sensory input.
- `source`: a string containing the source of the sensory input.
- `response`: an object containing a success message or an error message.

6. The code interacts with the Supabase API to insert data into a table.

7. The code handles errors by returning a response with a 500 status code and an error message. It also logs the error to the console.

8. No additional hints or guidance.

9. This file is a Deno serverless function that handles sensory input and inserts it into a Supabase database. It starts a server using `serve` and listens for incoming requests. If the request method is `OPTIONS`, it returns a response with CORS headers. Otherwise, it sets up a Supabase client using `createClient` and gets the user object using `getUser`. It then parses the request body for `input` and `source` and passes them to `handleSensoryInput`. The response is returned with CORS headers and a JSON content type. The code interacts with the Supabase API to insert data into a table. It handles errors by returning a response with a 500 status code and an error message. It also logs the error to the console. To reconstruct the file, start by importing the necessary modules and defining the `handleSensoryInput` function. Then, set up a server using `serve` and listen for incoming requests. If the request method is `OPTIONS`, return a response with CORS headers. Otherwise, set up a Supabase client using `createClient` and get the user object using `getUser`. Parse the request body for `input` and `source` and pass them to `handleSensoryInput`. Return the response with CORS headers and a JSON content type. Handle errors by returning a response with a 500 status code and an error message, and logging the error to the console.
