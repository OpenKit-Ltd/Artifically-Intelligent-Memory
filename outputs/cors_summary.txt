## Description
This file exports an object named `corsHeaders` that contains two properties: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`. These properties are used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for Supabase functions. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` property is set to `'*'`, which allows any domain to access the function. The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` property is set to a comma-separated string of allowed headers. This allows the client to send additional headers with the request, such as an API key or content type.
