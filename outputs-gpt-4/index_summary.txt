This file, named index.ts, is a Deno script that imports the serve function from the http/server module, the createClient function from the supabase module, the corsHeaders object from the cors module, and the handleSensoryInput function from the database module. The code sets up an HTTP server using the serve function, which takes an asynchronous callback function as its argument. This callback function handles incoming requests and performs various tasks, such as setting up a Supabase client, retrieving user information, parsing input data, and calling the handleSensoryInput function with the Supabase client, input data, and source data as its arguments. The callback function also handles error cases by returning a JSON response with an error message and a 500 status code. The server is set up to handle CORS by using the corsHeaders object in the response headers. The code interacts with the Supabase API to authenticate users and perform database operations. The main variables used in the code are supabaseClient, user, input, source, and response. To reconstruct this file, follow the provided code and descriptions, ensuring that the imports, function calls, and error handling are implemented correctly.
