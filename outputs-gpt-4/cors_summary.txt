The cors.ts file is a TypeScript file located in the supabase/functions directory. It does not have any imports. The file defines and exports a constant object named corsHeaders, which contains two key-value pairs representing CORS headers. The first key is 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', and its value is '*', allowing any origin to access the resource. The second key is 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', and its value is a string containing a comma-separated list of allowed headers: 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type'. There are no function calls, function definitions, or variables in this file. The code does not interact with external APIs, services, or other systems, and there is no error handling or edge case handling. To reconstruct this file, create a TypeScript file named cors.ts in the supabase/functions directory and define the corsHeaders object as described above, then export it.
