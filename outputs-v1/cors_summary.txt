9. Description: The cors.ts file is a TypeScript module that exports a constant object containing CORS headers. The object has two properties: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' and 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers'. The former is set to '*' to allow requests from any origin, while the latter is set to a comma-separated list of allowed headers. The code does not import any modules, define any functions, or interact with any external APIs or services. There is no error handling or edge case handling in the code. To reconstruct the file, simply create a new TypeScript module named cors.ts in the supabase/functions directory and export an object with the same properties and values as the corsHeaders object in the original code.
